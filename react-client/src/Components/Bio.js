        <h1>WHY TECH?</h1>
        <br></br>
        <a>When friends ask me what programming is, I say it's the closest thing
        to being an Alchemist; you put phrases and commands together...and magic
        happens! How cool is that?!</a>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
        <a>At least, that's how I felt when I was learning coding at night after work
        and realised that I hadn't had this much fun in a very long time. I'd achieved
        my early ambitions of a career in Advertising, now I was ready for a new adventure.</a>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <a>My vision isn't to change the world or take mankind to Mars - I know
        there are already some very smart people working on that. What I do believe
        is, in a world where 3D printers and self-driving cars have become a reality,
         some things should be easier than they currently are. So I love building
         things which make our everyday lives work like magic...or simply just for
         the fun of it.</a>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <a>I'm curently looking for a full-stack role in Vancouver.  So if you're part of
        a team who's looking for a Junior Developer please send me a message below.</a>
