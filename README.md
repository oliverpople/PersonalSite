# PersonalSite

My first ever React app that I built from scratch with two objectives in mind:

 1) To practise React.js, webpack and CSS.
 2) To create a public site with which I can represent myself online.
 
The app is deployed on Heroku here(http://wwww.oliverpople.com)

### Tech Stack

Front-End
- React.js
- Webpack.js
- JQuery

Back-End
- Node.js
- Express.js
- nodemailer

### Things I'd like to add given more time.

- Test Drive. One of my next development goals is to learn Jest so I can
start testing my React.js applications.
