# PersonalSite

A web app I built from scratch with two objectives in mind:

 1) To practise React.js and CSS. This is my first ever React.js app.
 2) To create a public site with which I can represent myself online.

### Tech Stack

Front-End
- React.js
- Webpack.js
- JQuery

Back-End
- Node.js
- Express.js
- nodemailer

### Things I'd like to add given more time.

- Test Drive. One of my next development goals is to learn Jest so I can
start testing my React.js applications.


### Getting Started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start with the following:

```
